# Risk Assessment
- *back: [QA Project Documentation](qa-project.md)*


### *Not having a working build of the application to submit by the deadline*

##### Evaluation
Risk not having a working application to submit.

##### Likelihood
This has a **moderate** likelihood.

##### Impact Level
The impact is **high** as I will perform poorly in my assessment. 

While any work done will still contribute towards my personal experience, and will by no means be wasted, it is also preferable that I work towards the deadline as will be expected in real-world projects.

##### Responsibility
The responsibility is mine.

##### Response
Still submit my code repository and project documentation. This is still demonstrative of what I am working towards.

I will also continue to work on the project regardless of assessment deadline. 

It is important that I continue to develop my skills, and produce working applications that are demonstrative of my capabilities. I can show and discuss these with potential employers.

##### Control Measures
I will **mitigate** this risk by periodically pushing working builds of the application to Github so that I can fall back to a working older version in the worst case scenario.

I will also use an agile development methodology to implement features in small pieces of work that result in a working application. It is important that every added feature results in a working minimum-viable-product.

### *Not having a project documentation to submit by the deadline*

##### Evaluation
Receiving a poor score on my project assessment, or failing completely.

##### Likelihood
The likelihood is **high** as I have a tendency to procrastinate on documentation.

##### Impact Level
The impact is **high** as I will perform poorly in my assessment. 

While any work done will still contribute towards my personal experience, and will by no means be wasted, it is also preferable that I work towards the deadline as will be expected in real-world projects.

##### Responsibility
The responsibility is mine.

##### Response
Still submit my application, as it impacts the grade.

##### Control Measures
I will create diagrams, take screenshots, and making notes in the project documentation as I go. I can demonstrate an agile approach to documentation where I can update it as I go.This ensures that I will definitely have *something* to submit by the deadline even if it's incomplete.

It is important that I don't leave the documentation to the last minute, so keep drafting notes, and chipping away at it as I work on the project.

### *Computer failure*
Any hardware or software issues with my computer that will result in it being unusable to complete the work.

##### Evaluation
I would not have a computer to develop my application on, or to write the project documentation.

##### Likelihood
This has a **low**-to-**moderate** likelihood. 

##### Impact Level
The impact would be **high** as it would prevent me from working on the project at all.

##### Responsibility
My responsibility.

##### Response
- Talk to my instructor.
- Fix my computer or acquire an alternative computer.

##### Control Measures
I will **mitigate** this risk by ensuring that a number of friends and family who have working computers are available, and willing to lend me a computer if this were to occur during the project.

By working with Java, I am already in a position where development can be performed cross-platform, so there is not a limit to the operating system of an alternate machine.

I will regularly push my code to Github, and take daily backups of my local computer files (including local repository). This ensures that I won't lose too much progress.

### *Illness or burnout restricting my progress*

##### Evaluation
I would not be able to work on my project if I fall ill.

##### Likelihood
This has a **moderate** likelihood, due to current Covid and flu viruses in the communnity. I also have a tendency to over-extend myself, due to high-expectations, and to get tunnel-vision with problems and neglect my personal health.

##### Impact Level
The impact would be **high** as it would prevent me from working on the project, but could also be very detrimental to me personally.

##### Responsibility
My responsibility.

##### Response
- Talk to my instructor.
- Take time to recover, and remember that failing this assessment is not the end of the world. My health is most important.

##### Control Measures
I will **mitigate** this risk by taking regular short breaks to move about, stretch and refocus my eyes.

I will also take regular longer breaks to do something besides the project. This includes meal breaks, running errands to get fresh air, and also to do hobbies so that I give my brain a chance to relax.
