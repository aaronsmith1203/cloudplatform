# Risk Assessment
- *back: [QA Project Documentation](qa-project.md)*

###### Risks
- 
- Possibility of missing deadline 
- Computer failure 
  - Java
- Illness or burnout , eye-strain
- unforeseen personal circumstances
- Procrastination
  - Regular breaks
- Application not building in the lead up to the deadline
  - attempt to build the application a day prior to the deadline, to leave time to resolve build issues.
  - Periodically push working builds of the application to Github so that older version can be fallen-back to in the worst case scenario
- Not completing all of the tasks assigned during a sprint.
- Being overly ambitious with what I can achieve in the time limit.
  - Using agile methodology.
  - Breaking work down into features that can be implemented individually using the feature-branch model of source-control, with the goal of the application functioning when the feature is pulled into the development branch. Regardless of how ambitious I am, I shouldn't get caught short without a working project.

### *Not having a serviceable application and project documentation to submit by the deadline*

##### Evaluation
Receiving an immediate failure in the my course assessment.

##### Likelihood
This is very likely as I have a tendency to over-extend myself, and I will be working with technologies that I'm still inexperienced with.

##### Impact Level
The impact is **high** as I will automatically fail my assessment. 

While any work done will still contribute towards my personal experience, and will by no means be wasted, it is also preferable that I work towards the deadline as will be expected in real-world projects.

##### Responsibility
The responsibility is mine.

##### Response
Continue to work on the project regardless of assessment deadline. 

It is important that I continue to develop my skills, and produce working applications that are demonstrative of my capabilities. I can show and discuss these with potential employers.

##### Control Measures
I will **mitigate** this risk by periodically pushing working builds of the application to Github so that I can fall back to a working older version in the worst case scenario.

I will also use an agile development methodology to implement features in small pieces of work that result in a working application. It is important that every added feature results in a working minimum-viable-product.

As the project involves documentation, I will create diagrams, take screenshots, and making notes in the project documentation as I go. I can demonstrate an agile approach to documentation where I can update it as I go.This ensures that I will definitely have *something* to submit by the deadline even if it's incomplete.

It is important that I don't leave the documentation to the last minute, so keep drafting notes, and chipping away at it as I work on the project.

### *Computer failure*

### *Being overly ambitious with regard to what I can achieve in the time limit*

what is the scenario?

##### Evaluation
what would happen if this scenario occurred?

##### Likelihood
This is very likely as I have a tendency to over-extend myself, and I will be working with technologies that I'm still inexperienced with.

##### Impact Level
how devastating to the project would it be if this occurred?

##### Responsibility
who's responsibility is it to mitigate this risk?

##### Response
what would we do if the scenario occurred?

##### Control Measures
what can we do to decrease the likelihood and/or impact?

- Mitigation - decreasing the likelihood of the hazard's occurrence, or the impact it would have on the project
- Acceptance - sometimes it can be too costly to mitigate the risk in comparison to the impact it would have on the project, in which case we may choose to do nothing
- Transfer - assigning the risk to a third party, usually in the form of an insurance policy
